__Victim__: Ukraine (Dozens of government department websites)

__Time line__: Several Ukranian government departments had their websites hacked on Jan 14th, 2022. News sources reported on the attack on Jan 16th, 2022.

__Facts/Damages__ - One example of an attack showed it to look like code of a ransomware, although no ransom was demanded. Microsoft has warned of such potential cyber attacks, so called "fake ransomware attacks," designed to look like a ransomware attack but it actually is designed for destroying data. The current stage of the attack is unknown, Microsoft continued, stating that the current stage is "the attackerâ€™s operational cycle or how many other victim organisations may exist in Ukraine or other geographic locations" is still unknown.

__Motive__: Very likely a political motive especially with tensions between Ukraine and Russia still at an all-time high even today.
Attribution: Ukranian officials have blamed a group within Belarus for the attack. Ukraine further alleges that Russia had some involvment, finding on Jan 14th, "that it had uncovered preliminary clues Russian security services could have been behind the cyber-attack." (At this time, no evidence has been provided publicly to back the claim)

__Opinion__: This is pretty interesting because the articles talked about the attack and the potential underlying implications. It seems to me that the potential of a disguised ransomeware attack could do some serious damage especially if the attacker's true intent really was to cripple any critical sector like we discussed in class. Going deeper, it made me realize how dangerous cyberattacks really could get because even the destruction of 1 criticial sector could leave their systems in shambles for months to come.
