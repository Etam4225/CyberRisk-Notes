# Week 2 - Various Case Studies + Cybersecurity General Info

### __Vocab/Keywords__: 
__TLP__ - Traffic Light Protocol For FBI Info Sharing 

__Raas__ - Ransomware as a service 

__CIA Triad__ - Objective is to ensure
- Confidentiality
- Integrity
- Availability

__Supply Chain attack__ - A third party attack where bad actors attempt to target software developers and suppliers in order to gain access to systems among external organizations as well

#### __General Notes:__

TLPs of varying colors (low to high):
- TLP - White : Info of little/no misuse
- TLP - Green : For taskforces
- TLP - Amber : Requires response, has consequences
- TLP - Red : Usually not for disclosure

__REvil (Sodinokibi)__ - Ransomware as a service (Raas):
- Threat of publication on the dark web (REvil's blog, Happy Blog)
- Were mentors for the gang DarkSide (Involved in the Colonial Pipeline attack)

__Maze Ransomware__ - Pioneers of the Double extortion model:
Concept of stealing company data and publishing it to pressure a ransom payment. 

Egregor - Raas that attacked Kmart

Conti - Much like Revil (Raas)

LockBit2.0 - Raas 
- Fast encryption

CIA Triad cont. :
- Confidentiality - who was access to data - should they have such access?
- Integrity - ensured data isn't changed or hasn't been tampered with
- Availability - Availability of the site, store, etc. from DDos attacks or ransomware locking down systems

Risk : 
- Malware erasing data
- Altered data
- Stolen data
- Attackers exploiting a vulnerability (log4j)
- Malicious code

16 Critical Infrastructures + Arguably a potential 17th with the legal sector* 

__Log4j__ was a zero-day vuln in a software library utilized for logging, that allowed remote code execution for hackers to inject code to execute anything they wanted to.

__Solar Winds__ - Supply Chain attack
- Targetted attack against Fire eye / Mandiant
  - State Sponsored attack by Russia
- High Profile Attack

Kronos - Log4j (HR Company)
- Payrolls of many employees disrupted as well as affect on MTA
- PII, General Payment compromised

Olympics - Why would it be a good target?
- Global, 100s of countries
- Athletes, PII and PHJI
- Hotel PII
- Guests info
- Tickets - Phishing
- AI usage, Robots
- Supply chain attack potential


Personal Note for Week 2: Every company can be a target for an attack.
