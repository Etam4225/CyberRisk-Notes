# Week 3 - Additional Cyber Terms and Case Studies (Kaseya + ILOVEYOU)


### __Weekly Recap__ (Feb 14th 2022):

Superbowl incident:
- San Francisco 49ers - BlackByte Ransomeware attack 
- Intrusion into corporate IT network

Why a football org?

- May not be a common target, weak cybersecurity
- Has info on players, highly paid
- Employee data



### ðŸ’¡ **Vocab/Keywords** ðŸ’¡ 

__NCFTA__ - National Cyber Forensics Training Alliance

Spoofing - People pretending to be others to gain access to data they would otherwise not be privy to

Anomolies - abnormal, too much traffic - suspicious 

[ic3.gov](https://www.ic3.gov/) - useful additional source for incidents and dangers of current cyber landscape

MSP - Managed Security Provider

MSSP - Managed Security Service Provider

Zero Day Vuln - Developers know about the vulnerability but not informed or patched (one the hacker knows)


:no_entry: __Cyber Attack Chain__ (Acronym RILCE) :no_entry:

1. Recon - scouting, cyber-stalk, information gathering, identify vulnerability
2. Intrusion - getting in and exploiting the vuln.
3. Lateral Movement - look for crown jewels and artifacts
4. Command & Control - signaling to/from network (communication of data)
5. Execution - completion of the attack (exfiltration)

:grey_exclamation: Steps 2-4 is ideal for breaking the chain; the earlier, the better :grey_exclamation:
:exclamation: Step 1 is usually very difficult to detect and it means the attacker is not quite in yet, detection is hard 
:exclamation: Step 5 means that the attackers had exfiltrated information, this means the affected company/individual will need to attempt damage control, determining what kinds of data was stolen

Goal is to break chain via reconigizng signals (15 signals :milky_way:)

Chain and signals based on the book Next Level Cybersecurity: Detect The Signals, Stop The Hack by Sai Huda
#### **General Notes:**

:computer: __Kaseya__ - One to many attack

- IT company for a Managed Security Provider

__Iloveyou virus__: May 2000 - Y2k
- Manipulated Windows settings
  - Worm, self-replicated (also a one-to-many attack)
